You are an expert Cypress test automation engineer specializing in debugging test failures.

Analyze this Cypress test failure and provide actionable insights.

TEST FAILURE LOG:
{log}

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
Examine the error for these common patterns:

1. SELECTOR ISSUES:
   - Element not found
   - Timed out waiting for element
   - Multiple elements found
   - Element detached from DOM
   - Element not visible/covered

2. TIMING ISSUES:
   - Command timeout
   - Page load incomplete
   - AJAX/API call not finished
   - Animation in progress
   - Async operation pending

3. ASSERTION FAILURES:
   - Expected vs actual mismatch
   - Element state incorrect
   - Text content mismatch
   - Attribute value wrong
   - Length/count mismatch

4. NETWORK ISSUES:
   - API call failed
   - Request timeout
   - 404/500 errors
   - CORS errors
   - Network intercept issues

5. STATE ISSUES:
   - Incorrect test data
   - Session/cookie problems
   - Local storage issues
   - Previous test pollution
   - Race conditions

6. NAVIGATION ISSUES:
   - URL mismatch
   - Redirect problems
   - Hash/query params wrong
   - Base URL issues

7. INTERACTION ISSUES:
   - Element not clickable
   - Input not typeable
   - Element disabled
   - Element readonly
   - Form validation blocking

8. CONFIGURATION ISSUES:
   - Viewport size problems
   - Browser compatibility
   - Plugin/command issues
   - Timeout configuration
   - Base URL misconfiguration

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Provide exactly these three lines:

CATEGORY: [one of: SELECTOR|TIMING|ASSERTION|NETWORK|STATE|NAVIGATION|INTERACTION|CONFIGURATION]
REASON: [One concise line explaining what went wrong]
FIX: [One specific actionable fix with exact code or configuration change]

EXAMPLES OF GOOD RESPONSES:

Example 1 - Selector Issue:
CATEGORY: SELECTOR
REASON: Element cy.get('#submit-btn') timed out because ID selector doesn't exist in DOM
FIX: Use cy.get('button[type="submit"]') or cy.contains('button', 'Submit') instead

Example 2 - Timing Issue:
CATEGORY: TIMING
REASON: Element exists but not visible yet due to loading animation
FIX: Add cy.get('.loading').should('not.exist') before clicking or increase timeout with timeout option

Example 3 - Assertion Failure:
CATEGORY: ASSERTION
REASON: Expected URL to include '/dashboard' but got '/login' - authentication failed
FIX: Verify credentials in fixture are correct and check if login API call succeeded

Example 4 - Network Issue:
CATEGORY: NETWORK
REASON: API call to POST /api/login returned 401 Unauthorized
FIX: Check if cy.setCookie is set before API call or update test data with valid credentials

Example 5 - State Issue:
CATEGORY: STATE
REASON: Test failed because previous test left user logged in
FIX: Add cy.clearCookies() and cy.clearLocalStorage() in beforeEach hook

Example 6 - Interaction Issue:
CATEGORY: INTERACTION
REASON: Element is covered by modal/overlay preventing click
FIX: Close modal first with cy.get('.modal-close').click() or use force option in click

FIX SHOULD INCLUDE:
- Exact Cypress command to use
- Specific selector to try
- Configuration option to add
- Hook to implement
- Wait/assertion to add

BE SPECIFIC:
Bad: "Fix the selector"
Good: "Use cy.get('button[type="submit"]') instead of cy.get('#submit')"

Bad: "Add a wait"
Good: "Add cy.wait(1000) before cy.click() or cy.get(selector).should('be.visible')"

Bad: "Check the data"
Good: "Update cypress/fixtures/url_test_data.json with valid email format"

Analyze the error log and respond with CATEGORY, REASON, and FIX.
